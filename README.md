**Scope**: Plan and track debt payoff with simulation options for various payoff methods (e.g., avalanche, snowball).

- **Features**:
  - Track outstanding debts (loans, credit cards).
  - Simulate payoff timelines with interest savings.
  - Visualize progress and compare payoff strategies.

- **Tech Stack**: `pandas`, `matplotlib`/`Plotly` for visualizations.
